# Digital-Twin-

**Abstract** - The various types of plastic waste produced for recycling include HDPE, LDPE, PP, HIPS, etc. However, the plastic recycling industry is facing significant difficulties due to a diverse workforce, a lack of product knowledge, a lack of communication between the supply chain and the product chain, and so forth. On the other hand, modern information and communication technology (ICT) offers new approaches and opportunities for managing and operating industrial processes. As a result, the research presented here introduces the plastic manufacturing industry to digital twins and Industry 4.0 enablers. The objective is to offer a comprehensive and trustworthy digital representation of each recycling facility, creating a customised service system. The innovative digital twin-based system for plastic recycling, which supports recycling operations across a product's life cycle, from design to recovery, is the key contribution made in this report. Meanwhile, machine learning models are created using the data from the digital twin to enable plastic recycling services and refine presumptions with high data interoperability. During system implementations, the feasibility of the proposed system and techniques are validated and assessed.

**Background & Research Question**

One of the key driving forces behind building the project is to increase the plastic recycling rate and reduce the use of plastic production. A study taken in Australia stated that from 2015 to 2019 the national average of plastic recycling for the above 4 years was only 11.5% despite the sharp exponential growth in consumption of plastics (3.5 million tonnes (Mt) in 2018â€“19) and Germany produce 1 million tons of plastic waste which are worth of 254 million euros, which is more than any other country in EU and 66% of their plastics produce are recycled which is quite impressive amongst other countries. China on the hand produces roughly seven million metric tons of plastic products every month. Since January 2020, the highest monthly output of plastic products was recorded in December 2021, at 7.95 million metric tons (Hossain et al., 2022) but only recycling 30% of the plastics produced. Table 1 depicts the plastic waste recycling rate for per capita GDP and per capita plastic waste in a few selected countries. Though the above-mentioned countries are developed countries we can see a contrasting number. Even though Germany has a good percentage of plastic being recycled there is still room for improvement However, doing so requires new technological innovation

**Research Questions**

In this project, we focus on developing the technology to solve the problems in a plastic recycling plant. We also choose to conduct our study in Australia due to the availability of data compared with other countries. with that said the problems we are trying to address are as follows
RQ1: What are the categories of waste currently generated in Australia and the amount of waste generation (quantitative assessment of plastic waste generation in terms of polymer types, sector, and state-level of generation)?
RQ2: Is there a way to actively monitor and log the data of a plastic recycling plant?
RQ3: Is it possible to build relationships between the supply chain and product chain?
RQ4: Can we use machine learning and data analytics to refine our assumption and product testing?
RQ5: What will be the estimated cost of building a twin system for a recycling plant?
RQ6: What are the prospects of implementing digital twin technology in Australia?
